# Breakout Boss Battle

An Android game with the basic Breakout design of sliding around a paddle which hits a ball at an angle, with a twist. A floating circle will bounce around the top part of the screen and the objective of the game is to reduce its health to 0. The boss's speed and size scale with its health. The boss starts out at 400 health and is very big and slow. As its health decreases, it will shrink significantly and rapidly speed up, making it a hard target to aim at.

The player has 4 lives to eliminate the boss. Everytime a ball falls below the screen a life is lost. Each ball will start by dealing an initial 1 damage on a hit, which is registed when the ball is traveling upwards and makes contact with the boss. Each time a ball hits the boss, that specific ball will get a bit redder in color, slightly speed up, and receives a permanent damage increase of 1. Balls are randomly generated and up to 3 can be in play at once. Additionally, players can opt to "super hit" the ball by tapping on the top half of the screen. A super hit is indicated by the slider turning red, and when it makes contact with a ball, it will launch directly up with a significant speed boost and will phase through the top of the screen, going out of play. Upon contact with the boss, a "super hit" ball will deal 5 times its normal damage, and if a "super hit" does at least 25 damage, the player will gain a life back (lives cannot exceed 4).
